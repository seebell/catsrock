    <h1>Cats are the best!</h1>
    <p1>
        There are lots of reasons why cats are the best. These small mammals are the perfect cuddling partners when you need; they can play with any object they find. They are independent; they wouldn't need your attention all the time. In fact, they will come to you whenever they want.

    <h2>They are different</h2>


    <p2>
        Unlike other pets; you don't actually own cats, they own you. Although they are aware that you are the parent and they understand everything you say, they tend to ignore what you tell them and do whatever they want instead.
